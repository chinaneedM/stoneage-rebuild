# Current State

Last updated: 2026-09-18

## Current phase

**Phase 0 — StoneAge Origin Archaeology**

The independent GitHub repository and continuity scaffold are established on remote `main`. GitHub read/write continuity has been verified, and the current workstream is primary-source recovery for the 1999 JSS client, beta, package, install/update system, original Gamer's Dream service layer, and named original-development staff.

## Confirmed project direction

- Single-player game, not a commercial MMORPG operation.
- Historical clients and materials are research samples, not code/assets to copy directly into the new game.
- **Research must not depend on the user buying or manually acquiring physical material.** No bidding, purchasing, shipping, opening, installing, or personally dumping original discs/packages is part of the project plan. Auction/marketplace pages are evidence surfaces only; free/public digital recovery is the operational path.
- Start from the earliest traceable JSS-era StoneAge rather than assuming Mainland China 1.82 is the absolute origin.
- Mainland 1.82 remains a major reference point because it is close to the user's childhood experience and is commonly remembered as a classic early form.
- Later systems/content may ultimately be integrated, but through coherent progression rather than a feature dump.
- Emotional milestones such as first pet capture, first ride, first major exploration, etc. are part of the design target.

## Current historical working picture

### FACT / high-confidence working facts

- StoneAge was developed by Japan System Supply (JSS).
- `STONEAGE` was publicly exhibited at Tokyo Game Show '99 Spring by **1999-03-19** in NTT Data's Gamer's Dream booth.
- Wayback reports archived captures of the original Gamer's Dream index beginning **1999-04-22**, so the pre-beta/pre-launch web layer is at least partially recoverable.
- By May 1999, contemporaneous `Play Online` coverage described the planned game as a relaxed Stone Age RPG emphasizing food/resources, community, and cooperative village development. This is FACT for **published pre-launch design intent**, not automatic proof of final shipped implementation.
- Beta recruitment closed **1999-08-20**; the beta itself ran **1999-09-01 through 1999-09-30**, supported by contemporaneous `Play Online` issue 015.
- The preserved `Play Online` issue 015 is now searchable deeply enough to recover the beta-application URL host as `www.dp.gamersdream.ne.jp` and its path tail as `PO/sa_apply.html`. One character immediately before `PO` remains OCR-ambiguous and is **not** normalized or guessed in the factual record.
- PC Watch reported on 1999-09-17 that the JSS title was scheduled for release on **1999-10-15**.
- A photographed period retail advertisement gives Windows 95/98 as platform, **1999-10-15** as scheduled release date, **8,800 yen before tax** as planned price, and prints the period domains `www.titan.co.jp` and `www.gamersdream.ne.jp`.
- The same advertisement visibly promotes an original mug as a reservation bonus and a `STONEAGE` special CD as an initial-edition bonus/feature.
- An archived first-party Gamer's Dream StoneAge product page independently lists **1999-10-15** as release date, package price 8,800 yen, a 4x or faster CD-ROM drive, at least 400 MB HDD, 64 MB RAM, MMX Pentium 200 MHz+, 33.6 Kbps+ Internet access, 2 MB+ VRAM, DirectX 6.1-compatible video/sound, mouse and keyboard.
- The same first-party product page tells users to **purchase the software package first and then register for Gamer's Dream service**, materially confirming a normal package-based install/client path.
- The archived official JSS manual confirms that the normal retail path used a StoneAge **game CD**, with DirectX 6.1 on that disc and an auto-start installer. Installation modes were standard, minimum and custom; `map` was a selectable component.
- The same JSS manual confirms a physical **CD NUMBER card** whose CD NUMBER was required for Gamer's Dream service registration/contracting. The manual also documents `[Stoneage]` -> `[stoneage]` as the Start-menu path and a `screenshot` subdirectory under the StoneAge folder.
- JSS product-identifier archaeology now has a verified Windows-family anchor: modern Japanese retailer data records **LIFESTORM** as Windows 95 CD software, model **`JV02005`**, JAN **`4909476301016`**. Other JSS-associated Windows products use different `4909476...` subranges (`古都の旅 京都` = `4909476502031`; `四柱推命入門 しゃべる桃源郷` = `4909476603011`), while JSS Game Boy/N64 titles occupy `49094768...`. Therefore the former shortcut of extrapolating StoneAge from the console sequence is rejected.
- A later collector-photo set now visibly depicts an early JSS/Gamer's Dream `STONEAGE` box/manual together with **two separate optical discs**. Because the project has not directly inspected the object or established an unbroken provenance chain, this is not S-grade package proof; however, combined with the first-party game-CD manual and contemporaneous bonus-CD advertising, it materially strengthens the separate game-CD + bonus-CD model.
- The same community article is not reliable as a blanket provenance source: its second Japanese package is visibly branded **BOTHTEC / DigiPark** and supports Windows 98SE/Me/2000/XP, despite wording that implies both packages are JSS-issued. Artifact-level visual evidence therefore takes precedence over that caption.
- A later first-person professional profile by **Yuki Tamura** states JSS employment from **May 1996 through October 2000**, role `3D Artist`, and explicitly lists **StoneAge** among JSS projects. Preserved 1997 JSS `Chameleon Twist` credits independently list Yuki Tamura under **Computer Arts** and **Game Design**, materially corroborating the named person's JSS identity. This is strong later staff evidence, not a contemporaneous StoneAge staff-credit list.
- A 2009 4Gamer retrospective states that Japanese service actually started on **1999-10-15**; together with the contemporary PC Watch report and archived Gamer's Dream product page, this date is the high-confidence working commercial start date.
- JSS's archived official version-up page contains an automatic update history beginning **1999-10-18**, only three days after launch. Therefore the retail disc, post-launch client states and later JSS builds must be treated as distinct archaeological states.
- The original JSS StoneAge startup/launcher executable filename is confirmed as **`stoneage.exe`**. JSS offered a replacement launcher advertised as **212 KB** and instructed users to overwrite the same-named file in the existing StoneAge installation directory.
- The JSS launcher-replacement page describes the replacement as addressing startup network errors, version-up errors and failure to transition to the new program after an update.
- The archived JSS FAQ exposes the update/install filesystem more concretely: `ProgramFiles\jss\stoneage`, `data\download`, `MFC42.DLL`, Windows `Temporary Internet Files`, proxy settings and an update-download error containing **`cksum:xxxxxxxxx`**.
- The FAQ tells users with version-up problems to clear `data\download` and Windows Temporary Internet Files, then retry; this supports a downloaded-file staging/cache model with checksum-related validation, while the exact checksum algorithm and update protocol remain OPEN.
- The FAQ also documents cleanup of data from an earlier StoneAge test by uninstalling, completely deleting `ProgramFiles\jss\stoneage`, then installing the retail product. The exact Japanese name/label of that earlier test is not reconstructed from damaged archive text.
- Wayback exposes an archived original path for `http://www.titan.co.jp/stoneage/stoneage.exe` and reports two captures; the available extraction interface identifies the archived object as `application/octet-stream`. The current environment has not obtained the binary bytes, so no checksum/PE metadata has been claimed.
- Archived Gamer's Dream notices from the JSS collapse period state that JSS handled the StoneAge game-application side, including software corrections and version upgrades, while Gamer's Dream handled server/service operation and billing. After JSS failed in October 2000, Gamer's Dream could continue only reduced service and package sales/version upgrades ceased under the prior arrangement.
- Taiwan and Mainland Chinese versions followed later and introduced localization/iteration layers.

Precise first-party claims are tied to `docs/SOURCE-REGISTRY.md`. Detailed research is split across:

- `research/clients/JSS-RETAIL-PACKAGE-PHOTO-EVIDENCE-R1.md`
- `research/clients/DESCENDANT-CLIENT-SOURCE-LINEAGE-R1.md` — explicitly lower-confidence later-source lineage clues, not 1999 JSS facts.
- `research/clients/STONEAGE-EXE-NEGATIVE-CONTROLS-R1.md` — fingerprints later same-name executables so false positives are excluded before JSS provenance analysis.
- `research/clients/JSS-PRODUCT-IDENTIFIER-ARCHAEOLOGY-R1.md` — reconstructs JSS JAN/model-number families to narrow the 1999 StoneAge retail-package search without assigning inferred identifiers.

### HYPOTHESIS / lower-confidence search leads

- The earliest StoneAge concept may have been much simpler in macro-lore than later versions, even though resource/community/village-life themes are directly attested in May 1999 design coverage.
- Much of the later macro-lore may have been progressively added to explain and extend an initially simpler world.
- Some mechanics remembered as "core StoneAge" by later players may not have existed for normal players in the earliest Japanese operation.
- The strongest current media model is now **strongly corroborated but not S-grade**: the 1999 initial-edition retail package likely contained a normal game/install CD and a physically separate special/bonus CD. The collector photograph visibly depicts two discs beside the early JSS box/manual, but direct inspection or first-party package-contents documentation is still required before the exact layout is promoted to unqualified FACT.
- Product-number search is now constrained by an observed common JSS JAN stem `4909476`, but the following ranges differ by product family. Check-digit-valid strings such as `4909476302013` and `4909476303010` are retained only as **unassigned search candidates** derived from a hypothetical continuation after LIFESTORM's `4909476301016`; direct searches found no reliable product association. `4909476805019`, previously tempting from the console sequence, is explicitly de-prioritized.
- The updater probably used a manifest/protocol that mapped downloadable files to checksum values, but the manifest filename, checksum algorithm, endpoint and payload format remain unresolved.
- The OCR-ambiguous character immediately before `PO/sa_apply.html` could be an old-style user-directory marker such as `~`, but this remains a **search hypothesis only** and is not the registered exact beta URL.
- Multiple later community-preserved client-source trees retain JSS/Gamer's Dream title identifiers. The Signally lineage uses `StoneAge.exe` as a launcher/update-facing program while project/debug metadata names a runtime `sa.exe`, and its runtime contains both `updated` and `CheckForUpdate`. A separate BismarckDD lineage also retains the same `CheckForUpdate` mutex while its current build target is itself `stoneage.exe` and the observed startup path lacks Signally's `updated` gate. Therefore updater coordination (`CheckForUpdate`) and launcher/runtime filename separation must be tested as **independent traits**. Later Taiwan troubleshooting independently records `cksum:...:File:sa.exe`, keeping **`sa.exe` a high-value original-artifact search target** without establishing it as a 1999 JSS fact.
- **Yuki Tamura** is now a plausible named candidate for at least part of the StoneAge 3D art/animation role described in the preserved anonymous project-leader recollections because Tamura self-reports JSS 3D art work and StoneAge participation. This remains **HYPOTHESIS**, not an identification of the recollection's unnamed `3D animator`.

## Highest-priority research questions

1. **Locate and verify the earliest recoverable JSS retail install/client medium or provenance-preserving image.**
   - Progress: contemporaneous retail advertising, official Gamer's Dream product page, official JSS manual, a later collector-photo set and a surviving Mercari initial-edition listing now independently constrain the artifact.
   - The collector photo visibly shows an early JSS box/manual with **two separate optical discs**, materially corroborating the game-CD + bonus-CD model while remaining below S-grade provenance.
   - The Mercari listing is now confirmed **sold**, but its live page exposes all **13 exact original-image URLs** and explicitly states that the unopened initial edition contains an initial-edition bonus CD-ROM. Those thirteen image targets are preserved in `docs/SOURCE-REGISTRY-PHYSICAL-MEDIA-R1.md`; their image bodies remain inaccessible through the current extraction path.
   - Confirmed JSS retail/client anchors: normal **game CD**, physical **CD NUMBER card**, `stoneage.exe`, `ProgramFiles\jss\stoneage`, `map` install component, CD-based auto-start installer, 1999-10-15 release and 8,800-yen package price.
   - Search lead from descendant lineages: inspect recovered media for `sa.exe` separately from `stoneage.exe`, plus `updated` and `CheckForUpdate`; these are not yet confirmed JSS-1999 strings.
   - Product-identifier progress: JSS Windows `LIFESTORM` is now cataloged as `JV02005` / JAN `4909476301016`; additional JSS Windows examples prove that the common `4909476` stem branches into multiple subranges, so console-number extrapolation is no longer used. A period LIFESTORM II ad fixes its release at 1999-02-20 and 8,800 yen but does not expose a readable JAN/model in the current scan.
   - Still missing: S-grade confirmation of the two-disc identities/layout, provenance-preserving retail disc image/dump, file tree, hashes, retail executable PE metadata, **direct StoneAge product/JAN code**, readable disc-label/back-box photos and complete package/manual/insert capture.
2. **Recover and fingerprint the archived JSS `stoneage.exe` replacement launcher.**
   - Progress: exact original JSS path is known; JSS advertised the file as 212 KB; Wayback reports two archived captures and exposes the object as binary content.
   - Current limitation: this environment has not extracted the bytes.
   - A known later false-positive `StoneAge.exe` is now fingerprinted and excluded: SHA-256 `9C019D9FAB9C0DC37A37A67519CA5080AE43EC2B2A84B915A24B742512A6A7CA` (2019 PE timestamp; 2010 copyright resource; Simplified-Chinese product metadata; `OriginalFileName=Sa.exe`).
   - Still needed: exact JSS byte size, SHA-256/SHA-1/MD5, PE timestamp, version resources, imports and strings; test `sa.exe`, `updated`, and `CheckForUpdate` independently rather than assuming they form one inseparable descendant architecture.
3. **Recover the automatic-update manifest/protocol and payload naming.**
   - Progress: first-party updater anchors include `data\download`, `cksum:xxxxxxxxx`, `MFC42.DLL`, Windows Temporary Internet Files/proxy behavior and `stoneage.exe`. Much later Taiwan troubleshooting records a descendant checksum error targeting `sa.exe`, showing that filename-bearing `cksum` records existed in a later lineage.
   - Still needed from JSS evidence: manifest/config filename, update host/path, checksum algorithm, payload filenames/extensions, the original `cksum` record structure and whether whole files or deltas were delivered.
4. **Determine the identity and contents of the initial-edition `STONEAGE` special CD.**
   - Progress: contemporaneous advertising proves the bonus-CD offer; the official manual separately proves a normal game CD; a later physical-package photograph depicts two separate discs alongside the early JSS box/manual; the sold Mercari initial-edition listing independently states that a bonus CD-ROM is included and exposes thirteen original-photo targets.
   - OPEN: S-grade confirmation that the photographed second disc is the advertised bonus CD, exact disc label/matrix identifier, filesystem/audio tracks, contents and hashes.
5. **Locate the September 1999 beta client or reliable binary/media evidence.**
   - Progress: beta recruitment deadline is **1999-08-20** and test period **1999-09-01 through 1999-09-30**; official FAQ confirms that data from an earlier StoneAge test could persist under `ProgramFiles\jss\stoneage`; the printed application URL is narrowed to host `www.dp.gamersdream.ne.jp` with path tail `PO/sa_apply.html`.
   - A second preservation path is now registered: Retromags independently catalogs `Play Online No.015 (September 1999)` (submitted 2023-12-14). It is a second scan route, not an independent historical source. The current extraction layer cannot yet fetch the file-detail/download body for visual comparison.
   - Still missing: the single OCR-ambiguous character before `PO`, an archived copy of the application page, tester/download instructions, installer/client filename, distribution method/media, hashes, internal version and beta-to-retail diff.
6. **Mine the surviving JSS/Gamer's Dream web archives for 1999 paths and support/update artifacts.**
   - Progress: JSS `manual.html`, `manual01.html`, `faqstart.html`, `verup.html`, `updater.html` and `stoneage.exe` paths are known; Gamer's Dream archive coverage begins before beta/launch; beta application matching can now target `*PO/sa_apply.html` rather than the whole domain.
   - Priority targets: update manifests/package names/endpoints; the exact August 1999 beta application capture and sibling tester/download pages; product/shop pages; registration; download/install instructions; support/version pages; any original occurrence of `sa.exe`, `updated` or `CheckForUpdate`.
7. Recover JSS launch box/manual inserts and original world-setting text not already represented by the archived online manual.
8. Determine the earliest documented appearance of:
   - the name "Nies / ニース / 尼斯";
   - the island-continent geography;
   - elemental/spirit lore;
   - pet riding for normal players;
   - major villages and early map topology.
9. Determine JSS-era internal numeric client version numbering.
10. Locate the earliest Taiwan client/manual/site and compare it with JSS material.
11. Locate a clean Mainland early/1.82 client/data set for later diff archaeology.
12. **Recover an original StoneAge staff-credit list and resolve named JSS roles.**
   - Progress: Yuki Tamura is now a named later first-person StoneAge/JSS staff lead with independent JSS-credit corroboration on `Chameleon Twist`; Hiroyuki Morioka remains a strong but unresolved project-leader identity hypothesis derived from the anonymous recollection lineage and `Chameleon Twist 2` credits.
   - Still needed: original StoneAge credits, staff page, period interview, or project-specific first-person statements that assign exact roles.

## Completed in the latest work pass

- User resource constraint was made explicit and promoted to a durable project rule: archaeology must not require buying, bidding on, shipping, opening, installing, or personally dumping physical StoneAge material.
- Marketplace/auction pages remain useful for public photographs, identifiers, package descriptions and provenance clues, but are **evidence surfaces only**, not acquisition opportunities.
- Added DD-008 so future conversations do not drift back into recommending purchase of rare clients/packages.
- Reframed immediate actions around free/public digital recovery, archived scans, public listings/catalogs, preservation sites, source trees and any freely retrievable original media.


- Re-verified remote `main` before continuing and confirmed `9d19112ae18ad9fb878def5b972b1ea8fbc133cf` / tree `75f16ea3b233f43fc86647abbac823eb4dffa17e` remained authoritative.
- Continued the highest-priority physical-media/product-identifier search rather than guessing a StoneAge JAN.
- Recovered a high-value same-medium anchor from Suruga-ya: JSS Windows 95 `LIFESTORM` = model `JV02005`, JAN `4909476301016`.
- Recovered two additional JSS-associated Windows catalog identifiers: `古都の旅 京都` = `4909476502031`; `四柱推命入門 しゃべる桃源郷` = `4909476603011`.
- Rechecked JSS console identifiers: `チャルボ55` = `4909476802018`, `カメレオンツイスト` = `4909476803015`, `カメレオンツイスト2` = `4909476804012`.
- Established the controlled observation that the shared `4909476` stem spans several product families, while the following ranges differ. This invalidates the prior shortcut of treating `4909476805019` as a likely StoneAge code merely because it follows the console sequence.
- Located a preserved period `LIFESTORM II` advertisement showing Windows 95/98, `1999年2月20日発売`, and 8,800 yen. Its currently accessible scan does not reveal a readable JAN/model number.
- Generated `4909476302013` and `4909476303010` only as check-digit-valid **search candidates** under a hypothetical continuation of LIFESTORM's PC subseries. Direct web/catalog searches returned no reliable association, so neither number is assigned to LIFESTORM II or StoneAge.
- Added dedicated product-identifier research and source-ledger files so future searches can distinguish verified identifiers from merely syntactically valid candidates.
- No StoneAge JAN/model code was promoted without direct evidence.

## Immediate next actions

1. Continue **zero-cost public-source StoneAge package research**: preserve/recover the 13 Mercari original-image bodies and any freely accessible back/side-box images that can expose JAN/model text. Do not pursue purchase, bidding, seller contact, shipping, or user-side acquisition.
2. Recover a **LIFESTORM II** retail identifier (JAN and model/type code) from freely accessible box scans, Japanese retailer/distributor databases, auction archives, cached listing images, or period catalogs. Use live listings only as public evidence, never as acquisition targets.
3. Strengthen the two-disc model using **publicly obtainable provenance evidence**: identify the direct StoneAge product/JAN, readable disc labels/matrix codes where public photographs expose them, and determine which disc is the game/install CD versus the advertised bonus CD. Treat numeric sequence candidates only as search keys; do not require possession of the object.
4. If an original retail/beta client or media image becomes **publicly retrievable at no cost** (or is voluntarily supplied to the project), analyze it outside the repository and record hashes/file trees only; inspect for `stoneage.exe`, `sa.exe`, installer/autostart metadata, `map`, update configuration, `data\download`, `updated` and `CheckForUpdate`.
5. Obtain either the Retromags or Kingpin No.015 scan body through a file-capable route and visually inspect the printed beta URL; use the second scan to resolve the one OCR-ambiguous character before `PO/sa_apply.html` rather than guessing it. Then match the resulting path to an August 1999 archive capture and enumerate sibling tester/download paths.
6. Mine archived JSS pages and paths using `data/download`, `cksum`, `MFC42.DLL`, `ProgramFiles/jss/stoneage`, `map`, and `stoneage.exe`; test descendant-derived `sa.exe`, `updated`, and `CheckForUpdate` as **independent** candidate traits so a hit on one is not treated as proof of the others.
7. Search Yuki Tamura and other independently identified JSS staff for StoneAge-specific portfolios, interviews or staff credits; use exact named-role evidence to test the anonymous developer-recollection corpus rather than merging identities by inference.
8. Continue attempting provenance-preserving extraction of the archived JSS `stoneage.exe`; if bytes become obtainable, analyze them outside the repository and record only hashes/metadata/derived findings.
9. Once any original retail/beta binary or media is recovered, establish the reproducible client-archaeology pipeline: hashes, PE metadata, file tree, resource inventory, strings, asset IDs, update-state labeling and cross-version diff.

## Continuity status

- Repository: `chinaneedM/stoneage-rebuild`
- Default branch: `main`
- Visibility: public
- Authority: latest GitHub remote state is the single source of truth for project continuity.
- Canonical restart protocol: `docs/PROJECT-CONTINUITY-PROTOCOL-R1.md`

## Blockers

No repository or workflow blocker.

The project still lacks a provenance-preserving **publicly obtainable** 1999 JSS retail disc image/dump and September 1999 beta binary. The physical-package blocker remains narrowed to inaccessible original photo bodies plus missing exact disc identities/matrix/JAN identifiers. The beta web-recovery blocker remains a nearly complete application-page path; Retromags now supplies a second scan target, but its image/file body is not retrievable through the present extraction path. The developer-lineage track now has a named, independently cross-checked JSS/StoneAge staff lead in Yuki Tamura, but the original StoneAge credit list and exact staff-role mapping remain unresolved. The retail/client search retains `sa.exe`, `updated`, and `CheckForUpdate` only as descendant-derived search traits until original JSS material confirms each one independently. The binary/media blocker remains the principal Phase 0 constraint.
