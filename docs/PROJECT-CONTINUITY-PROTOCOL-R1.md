# Project Continuity Protocol R1

## 1. Purpose

This protocol exists so the StoneAge project can continue across new conversations without relying on transient chat context.

The **GitHub remote repository state is the single source of truth** for project progress, research status, design decisions, and next actions.

Chat memory may help orientation, but it must never override the repository.

## 2. Startup procedure for every new conversation

When the user sends the restart message, the assistant must:

1. Identify the `stoneage-rebuild` repository owned by the user.
2. Read the latest remote default branch state.
3. Read, in this order:
   - `README.md`
   - `docs/PROJECT-CONTINUITY-PROTOCOL-R1.md`
   - `docs/CURRENT-STATE.md`
   - `docs/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md`
   - `docs/HISTORICAL-TIMELINE.md`
   - `docs/SOURCE-REGISTRY.md`
4. Inspect recent commits to determine what changed most recently.
5. Resume from the highest-priority unfinished item in `docs/CURRENT-STATE.md` unless the user gives a new priority.
6. Do not ask the user to restate already-recorded project history.

## 3. Canonical restart message

> 继续《石器时代》项目。按仓库 `docs/PROJECT-CONTINUITY-PROTOCOL-R1.md` 启动，以 GitHub 远端最新状态为唯一事实源。先读取连续性协议、`docs/CURRENT-STATE.md` 和最新提交，然后从最高优先级未完成事项继续推进。

A shorter equivalent is acceptable if it explicitly names the protocol and says the latest GitHub remote state is authoritative.

## 4. Evidence taxonomy

Every important claim must be tagged conceptually as one of:

- **FACT** — supported by evidence currently considered reliable enough to state as fact.
- **HYPOTHESIS** — plausible interpretation or inference that still requires confirmation.
- **DESIGN** — a decision for our rebuilt game; not a historical claim.
- **OPEN** — unresolved research question.

Do not silently promote HYPOTHESIS to FACT.

## 5. Source hierarchy

Prefer evidence in this order:

1. Contemporaneous official material: original client, manual, official site, patch notes, packaging.
2. Contemporaneous press and magazines.
3. Preserved binaries, source trees, data files, videos, screenshots with provenance.
4. First-party developer/staff recollections.
5. Later official retrospectives.
6. Contemporary player guides and archives.
7. Later player recollections / community reposts.

Conflicts must be recorded rather than flattened.

## 6. Documentation discipline

At meaningful milestones:

- Update `docs/CURRENT-STATE.md`.
- Add new historical claims and uncertainty to `docs/HISTORICAL-TIMELINE.md`.
- Add sources to `docs/SOURCE-REGISTRY.md`.
- Record irreversible/high-impact design choices in `docs/DESIGN-DECISIONS.md`.
- Commit with a message describing the milestone.

Before ending a long work session or when context limits are approaching, update `docs/CURRENT-STATE.md` so the next conversation can resume without reconstruction.

## 7. Development discipline

Historical reconstruction and modern game implementation are separate layers.

- Research material informs specifications.
- Specifications inform the modern implementation.
- Original technical debt is not inherited merely for historical fidelity.
- Historical assets are not automatically production assets.
- Later-version content may be adopted only through explicit design decisions and coherent world integration.

## 8. Repository safety

Do not place copyrighted proprietary binaries/assets into the repository by default. Store hashes, metadata, filenames, screenshots only where legally appropriate, and research notes instead.

Do not rewrite or delete historical evidence records to make a later theory look cleaner; supersede them with dated corrections.
