# stoneage-rebuild

A long-term research and development project to reconstruct the origins, evolution, and core experience of **StoneAge / 石器时代**, then rebuild it as a modern single-player 2D turn-based RPG.

## Project intent

This project is **not** a binary patch, private-server repack, or direct copy of an old client. The historical clients, manuals, screenshots, magazines, websites, videos, and later regional versions are treated as research evidence.

The development goal is to:

1. Use the accepted **Taiwan Waei/JSS v1.0 clean retail client** as the historical foundation baseline for reconstruction.
2. Preserve provenance and inventory the baseline at file level, then recover its executable/runtime structure, resource formats and deterministic gameplay state.
3. Reconstruct maps, characters, pets, attributes, skills, items, NPC/world systems, UI, text/data tables and other game rules using version-tagged evidence; original server-only content is reconstructed rather than assumed to be present on the retail disc.
4. Diff earlier/later clean official versions when available to reconstruct evolution across JSS, Taiwan, Korea, Mainland China and later branches; later releases are a design/content library rather than mandatory cumulative upgrades.
5. Reimplement the resulting specifications as a private/local-first single-player game with MMORPG-style depth, modern rendering/input/save architecture, and independently created/recreated production assets.
6. Preserve the emotional milestones and core StoneAge design DNA while deliberately redesigning pacing, systems and content where the modern project requires it.

## Current phase

**Phase 1 — Foundation Baseline Technical Reconstruction & Specification**

The Taiwan Waei/JSS v1.0 retail client is accepted as the R1 historical foundation baseline. Open-ended hunting for an absolute-earliest client is no longer on the critical path.

Primary targets:

- close the remaining v1.0 runtime/gameplay semantics that materially affect reconstruction;
- convert recovered graphics, animation, battle, audio, protocol and state evidence into engine-neutral deterministic specifications;
- reconstruct world/map and server-authoritative content from version-tagged evidence without falsely projecting later data into v1.0;
- use later official versions and recovered server/master data as controlled bridges and a future design/content library;
- keep earlier-client discovery opportunistic and non-blocking;
- prepare the local-first single-player architecture without prematurely building MMO services.

See [`docs/CURRENT-STATE.md`](docs/CURRENT-STATE.md).

## Continuity

Every new ChatGPT conversation must start from the repository rather than chat memory.

Read [`docs/PROJECT-CONTINUITY-PROTOCOL-R1.md`](docs/PROJECT-CONTINUITY-PROTOCOL-R1.md) first.

Recommended restart message:

> 继续《石器时代》项目。按仓库 `docs/PROJECT-CONTINUITY-PROTOCOL-R1.md` 启动，以 GitHub 远端最新状态为唯一事实源。先读取连续性协议、`docs/CURRENT-STATE.md` 和最新提交，然后从最高优先级未完成事项继续推进。

## Repository layout

- `docs/` — project vision, continuity, historical timeline, decisions, current state.
- `research/origin/` — JSS-era origin research.
- `research/clients/` — client/version archaeology and future diff reports.
- `research/sources/` — source notes and archival metadata.
- `game/` — future modern game implementation.
- `tools/` — archaeology/parsing/diff tooling.
- `tests/` — future deterministic tests.

## Copyright boundary

Do not commit copyrighted original game binaries, ripped art, music, sound effects, manuals, or other proprietary assets unless their legal status and repository policy explicitly allow it. Prefer storing metadata, hashes, filenames, observations, and research notes. The rebuilt game should use independently implemented code and newly created/recreated assets.


## Current restoration roadmap — 2026-10-16

Use [Restoration Roadmap R2](docs/RESTORATION-ROADMAP-R2.md) and the latest
CURRENT-STATE entry for the current work order. Priority is PET-STATE-01: qualify current capture-to-owned-pet state sources
and repair only evidence-supported missing joins. Reuse the closed four
hometown routes for later finite overall acceptance; do not repeat them.
The deep client-local savedata helper branch is paused as non-blocking; its
R1–R78 evidence and R79 preflight remain preserved. Restoration still precedes
joint new-game design.


### Current package update — 2026-10-16

PET-STATE-01 has bounded capture/roster/save/reentry/growth acceptance; full
pet autoconstruction remains evidence-limited and requires explicit state.
Highest next is WORLD-01's finite existing-route provenance/gap review, as
recorded in the latest CURRENT-STATE and Roadmap R2 append. R79 stays paused.


### Current work order override — 2026-10-16 Stage A source review

Earlier dated roadmap notes above remain historical context. The authoritative
current work order is the **latest** entry in `docs/CURRENT-STATE.md`.
After the WORLD-01 and bounded RULES-01 representative integration checks,
`STAGE-A-REVIEW-PREFLIGHT` has audited all nine system families without
claiming Stage A completion. The next finite target is `UI-SEMANTICS-01`:
five original Taiwan-v1 client protocol-to-interaction/resource specifications.
Stage A remains PARTIAL/OPEN, Stage B gated and client-local savedata R79 paused.
No original server-only game content is inferred from modern model tests.


### Latest restoration package — UI-SEMANTICS-01 (2026-10-16)

Accepted on a separate branch and source/CI qualified: five original Taiwan
v1 client protocol/UI **input** crosswalks, 16 decoded-record source contracts
and 14 compiled message envelopes. Visual screen placement, art-selection
runtime and original commercial server content remain unproven. Next finite
priority: **UI-RESOURCE-BIND-01**, only original pet graphic selector and
battle SAB/palette selector evidence, not a new engine or post-1.0 UI.
Authoritative detailed order remains the final entry of CURRENT-STATE.


### Latest restoration scope — UI-RESOURCE-BIND-01 (2026-10-16)

Original v1 battle resource identity, address order and lineage-supported
20×20 SAB interpretation now have bounded reference validation; actual
v1 battle palette/background selection and pet drawing-to-animation
bindings remain OPEN. Next priority:
**STAGE-A-NPC-CONTENT-BOUNDARY-01**, source-qualified NPC/quest/dialogue
coverage and missing original-server content. See CURRENT-STATE.


### Current user-review deliverable — 2026-10-16

The [Stage A consolidated review packet](docs/STAGE-A-CONSOLIDATED-REVIEW-R1.md)
is the current user-facing restoration overview, including nine system families,
seven representative player flows, five bounded blockers and source-qualified
skill/equipment/trade/riding specification entry points. The adjacent JSON
manifest pins sources and selective replay commands. Its publication is not
Stage A acceptance: seven families remain PARTIAL, two OPEN, Stage B GATED.
Highest next: STAGE-A-JOINT-REVIEW-01; an ordinary continuation stays in Stage A
and may pursue EARLY-CONTENT-RECOVERY-01 only as bounded, material source work.
R79 remains paused nonblocking; latest CURRENT-STATE governs.


### Latest Stage A decision and new StoneAge design handoff — 2026-10-17

The project owner delegated the previous A/B/C choice, and the assistant selected **B**:
accept the **evidence-limited Stage A historical research review checkpoint**, with
all seven PARTIAL and two OPEN system-family historical statuses preserved.
This does **not** certify a fully restored original game, early commercial
server world, complete original quest/persistence, or a percentage of
historical completion. A future authenticated new early source can reopen
the specific evidence contract without erasing earlier results.

Current controlling decision: [bounded Stage A acceptance](docs/STAGE-A-EVIDENCE-LIMITED-ACCEPTANCE-R1.md).
Next collaborative input: [Stage B design discussion brief](docs/STAGE-B-COLLABORATIVE-DESIGN-BRIEF-R1.md).
**Design discussion is ready; production, final engine lock-in and new content
implementation have not started.** Latest CURRENT-STATE and independent CI
have authority over older README/NEXT markers.

 
### Current research priority — 2026-10-18 (source-ready 22-domain restoration)

The latest repository [22-domain source-ready review](docs/STONEAGE-22-DOMAIN-SOURCE-READY-REVIEW-R2.md)
preserves all historic PARTIAL/OPEN boundaries. A new *original Taiwan v1.0*
SPR-frame-to-bitmap category intersection report has been independently
executed and archived with source ZIP/JSON checksums:
`research/recovered/STONEAGE-TW10-VISUAL-CATEGORY-SPR-JOIN-R1.json`.
It validates only numeric original resource links, **not actual pet species,
avatar identities, first-generation quests or live drawing**. Previous early
server/pet identity work remains evidence-limited. Next finite source task:
`TW10-ITEM-STATIC-BITMAP-SOURCE-SELECTOR-01`. Stage B production and public
wiki implementation have not begun; R79 is paused and the full history in
CURRENT-STATE remains authoritative.

 
### Source-driven original item static resource checkpoint — 2026-10-18

The original Taiwan v1.0 `S:I` full item, `I` incremental item,
and `C` ground-item messages have pinned `graphic_id` field
positions. The player-labeled item bitmap range 5973–7003 contains
1,031 actual original ADRN records and 1,030 distinct source
block hashes (bitmap IDs 6042/6077 share a block hash). This is **not**
a historically verified original 1,031-item table or proven
`graphic_id -> bitmapno` draw path. Provenance and executable
checks are in
`docs/STONEAGE-TW10-ITEM-STATIC-BITMAP-SOURCE-R1.md`.
Next bounded T03 is `TW10-MAP-CONTENT-ORIGINAL-RESOURCE-BOUNDARY-01`.
Stage B production and wiki remain gated.
